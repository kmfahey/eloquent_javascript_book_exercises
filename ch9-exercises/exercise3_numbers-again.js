/*
 * Numbers Again
 *
 * Write an expression that matches only JavaScript-style numbers. It must
 * support an optional minus or plus sign in front of the number, the decimal
 * dot, and exponent notationâ€”5e-3 or 1E10â€”again with an optional sign in
 * front of the exponent. Also note that it is not necessary for there to be
 * digits in front of or after the dot, but the number cannot be a dot alone.
 * That is, .5 and 5. are valid JavaScript numbers, but a lone dot isnâ€™t.
