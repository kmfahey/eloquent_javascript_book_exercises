/*
 * Roads Module
 *
 * Write a CommonJS module, based on the example from Chapter 7, that contains
 * the array of roads and exports the graph data structure representing them as
 * roadGraph. It should depend on a module ./graph , which exports a function
 * buildGraph that is used to build the graph. This function expects an array of
 * two-element arrays (the start and end points of the roads).
